/**
 * This test case tests the MapAdapter functionality of medium-sized instances
 * (maps with 100.000 elements). Verifies all MapAdapter methods work correctly
 * with a consistent number of elements. For each method tests are created to
 * ensure correct behavior in normal and edge cases, including correct throw of
 * exceptions and correct return values.
 *
 * @test.design This test case is designed to ensure that the MapAdapter class
 * behaves correctly when it contains a consistent number of items. It checks
 * that all methods return expected results when the map has many items,
 * ensuring the {@link myAdapter.HMap} interface is implemented correctly.
 * @test.libraries JUnit 4.13, Hamcrest 1.3
 * @see myAdapter.MapAdapter
