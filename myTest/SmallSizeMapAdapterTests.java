/**
 * Tests the MapAdapter class functionality with small-sized maps (containing 5

 * normal and edge cases, including correct throw of exceptions and correct
 * return values.
 *
 * @test.design This test case aims to verify the correct behavior of MapAdapter
 * instances with a minimal but non-zero number of elements, ensuring the
 * {@link myAdapter.HMap} interface is implemented correctly.
